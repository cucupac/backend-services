# Ax Relayer

This monorepo contains all code relevant to the Ax Relayer Service.

Currently, Wormhole is the only protocol supported by this service, but support for other cross-chain messaging protocols will be added as necessary.

See [README in /wormhole directory](./wormhole/README.md) for architecture details.
